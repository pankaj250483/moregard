        <h2>Cost-Effective Payroll Services for Your Business</h2>
        <p>On average, small business owners spend eight hours per month on payroll-related tasks. While it may not seem
          like a lot of time, it does add up--and it takes time away from running your business.</p>
          <p>If you own a small to medium-sized business with more than a few employees, you already know that payroll is complicated. It seems
          like every year a new piece of federal, state, or local legislation related to payroll is passed that you need
          to comply with. </p>
          <p>If you're just starting out, you may only have a few employees to worry about. You might be
          able to handle payroll on your own, but wouldn't your time be better spent on developing. new products or
          services for your business?</p>

        <h2>Helping You Build the Foundation for a Successful Business </h2>
        <p>The decision to start a new business is an exciting one, but as every experienced business owner knows,
          there's more to it than developing a product and hoping it sells. As an entrepreneur, you're probably a "big
          picture" person with a vision. You'd rather not deal with nitty-gritty details like choosing a business
          entity, sales and payroll tax, or accounting systems that help you manage cash flow. The good news is that
          we're here to help you figure it out. </p>
        <h2>What We Do for You: </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Determine which business entity best meets your goals and minimizes tax liability</li>
          <li>Partnership agreements</li>
          <li>Prepare a cash flow budget</li>
          <li>Create a business plan to help you secure financing (if needed)</li>
          <li>Set up an accounting system using software that works for you</li>
          <li>Create billing systems and implement policies and procedures for collections</li>
          <li>Make sure you are compliant with state, local, and federal tax laws such as sales and use tax, payroll
            tax, and Federal EIN (Employer Identification Number)</li>
          <li>Prepare annual tax returns and quarterly estimated taxes as needed</li>
          <li>Assist you in filing paperwork for state and local licenses and permits as required</li>
          <li>Assess your business insurance needs</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Planning for Success - and Profit </h2>
        <p>The keys to a successful - and profitable - business are meticulous planning and a methodical approach to
          running your business. Failing to do this in the initial stages of business formation is often a recipe for
          disaster, and it's the reason most businesses fail. Don't let it happen to you.</p>
